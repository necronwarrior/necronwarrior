		This project was created over 3 months of 9-5 weekday work for a client based on an initial brief and then feedback.</br>
		One of the challenges I had assigned myself for this project was to act as more of a programmer in a seperate department from the designers, artists and audio engineers. I.e. That I would not intensly involve myself in the design and feel of the project and stick more to what the team would expect of a programmer.<br>
		The main lesson learned from that challenge is that mindset is only possible in a larger team and can be very dangerous in a small team that needs whatever it can get in terms of resources - as by the end of the project I had been assigned to rewrite the script due to client unhappiness and had to plot out the negative design space that had been unintentionally left and forgotten about.<br>
		<br>
		As well as knowledge about what is required in a small team, another strong lesson to come out of this project was the need for experimentation and self-created direction in the face of client unresposiveness, as a major shortfall that the team encountered was a dependance on client feedback to assert direction - leaving the team aimless at points.
